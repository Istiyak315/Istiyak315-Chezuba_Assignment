# WHY MY SOLUTION IS EFFECTIVE

1.The solution makes use of simple loops and conditionals to handle the carry,
  ensuring correctness without over-complicating the logic.
  
2.The solution correctly handles edge cases like all 9's by resizing the array when necessary.

3.The solution runs in linear time, which is optimal for this type of problem.
  The space complexity is also efficient since it only allocates additional space when required.
